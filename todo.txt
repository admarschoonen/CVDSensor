Things to do or ideas to implement:
* fix inverted / differential measurement
* distance measurement
* setParallelCapacitanceManually
* allow negative capacitance (in case parallelCapacitance is calibrated
  correctly, capacitance under test is small and there is some noise)
* correct gain and / or offset in normal / inverted modes?
* gestures (wheel / slider / touchpad / keyboard)
* sample type invert: 1023 - sample
* example code with button to measure SNR
* auto enable slewrate based on noise variance?
* IIR filter
* charge pin when number of sensors is 1 (provides speed up of almost 2 x)
* documentation (manual + presentation)
* update paper on nCharges based on capacitance instead of distance
* example code with wireless communication to measure common mode noise?
* combine multiple sensors for proximity sensing?
* add option for RC guard
* make N_MEASUREMENTS_PER_SENSOR optional (default to 16)?
* allow shorter time for recalibration if forceCalibrationAfterRelease is set?
* move some parameters from per sensor to CvdSensor object
* add wireless to debug conducted noise immunity
